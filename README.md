# Hey, I'm Hiba! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“

**AI student â€¢ Curious mind**

Iâ€™m chasing the frontiers of intelligence.

Can AI truly understand, learn, and reason like humans, or is it only an illusion of thinking?

## What I'm Exploring
- Research that bridges theory and practice (because discovery lights me up)
- Reading more AI papers than is probably healthy
- Opening the black box of AI systems to understand their decision-making
  


*Discovering **elegant structures** within complex architectures; building intelligence that is **explainable** and **safe**.*

---

*Always learning, always questioning, always building.*
