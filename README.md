# Hey, I'm Hiba! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“

**AI student â€¢ Curious mind**

Iâ€™m chasing the frontiers of intelligence â€” from neural networks to agents that reason.  
Thereâ€™s beauty in machines that solve math like humans do.  
And **AI4Math**? Thatâ€™s where the magic happens.

## What I'm Exploring
- Research that bridges theory and practice (because discovery lights me up)
- Reading more AI papers than is probably healthy
- How **reinforcement learning** can tackle math problem
  
## My path through AI 
```
Computer Vision â†’ NLP â†’ Agentic AI â†’ Reinforcement Learning â†’ AI4Math
```
Each step opened new doors. But at the intersection of **mathematics and intelligence**,  
I found what I truly love: elegant logic, messy data, and models trying to reason.
