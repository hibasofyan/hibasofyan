# Hey, I'm Hiba! 👋🤓

AI student. Curious mind. Forever asking **what if?**

I spend a lot of time wondering: Does AI really understand us? Can it learn and reason the way humans do?

How do our language, actions, and choices emerge from our hidden beliefs and intentions? Could AI ever trace those invisible threads?
What does a "functional" Theory of Mind even look like in a neural network?


And the big one: How do we build this... without also building the perfect manipulation-as-a-service?

## What I'm Exploring
- Research that bridges theory and practice (because discovery lights me up)
- Reading more AI papers than is probably healthy
- Studying ways to advance Theory of Mind in AI systems without compromising safety

*Discovering **elegant structures** in complex architectures; building intelligence that is both **explainable** and **safe**.*

*Always learning, always questioning, always building.*
